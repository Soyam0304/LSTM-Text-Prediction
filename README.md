Next-Word Prediction using LSTM
This repository contains the implementation of a Next-Word Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The project aims to predict the next word in a sequence of text based on previous input, leveraging the sequential nature of language data.

Project Overview
Next-word prediction is a crucial component of many modern applications such as autocomplete features, virtual assistants, and chatbots. This project focuses on understanding how deep learning models, particularly LSTMs, can be utilized to capture the context and semantics of natural language data to make accurate predictions.

The model was trained on a prepared dataset, and it achieved an impressive 94% accuracy on the training data, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning linguistic patterns.

Features
Preprocessing of raw text data to generate meaningful sequences for training.
Implementation of a deep learning model using LSTM layers for capturing sequential dependencies in text data.
Training and evaluation with detailed performance metrics.
Visualization of model performance and insights into data patterns (if added).
Flexibility to test with custom input sequences for next-word predictions.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises text sequences that were tokenized and preprocessed to create a suitable input-output format for the LSTM model. Key preprocessing steps include:

Cleaning and normalizing the text.
Tokenizing the text into words and creating integer mappings.
Preparing input sequences with a fixed context length for predicting the next word.
The dataset can be substituted with other corpora to adapt this model for various applications like domain-specific text predictions.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for model development.
Keras/TensorFlow: For building and training the LSTM model.
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and model exploration.

Results
The LSTM model was trained using an effective data pipeline and hyperparameter tuning, achieving 94% accuracy on the training data. The high accuracy indicates that the model effectively learns patterns in the text data, although care should be taken to ensure generalizability on unseen data.
